# Welcome to MATH 452/552

Welcome to mathematical statistics. 

A few beginning of course announcements. Remember: This is a remote and asynchronous course.

# Website

Information for the course can be found on blackboard or at gjhunt.github.io/452spring2021

# Lectures

The lectures are remote and asynchronous. Each week I will post two lectures for that week which will each be 80 minutes long. They will be posted to youtube with links posted on the github page. I will also post a .pdf of the lecture notes from that week along with the videos.

** The first lectures will be posted this Thursday. **

# Book

There is no required book for this course. My lectures/notes should be enough to do everything in the course. HOWEVER, many students understandably like an accompanying text. Two excellent books on mathematical statistics are

1. Statistical Inference by Casella and Berger (2nd Edition): https://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Inference-George-Casella/dp/0534243126

This is an advanced undergraduate/masters level book. My lectures will be closely following along with this book so I highly suggest that students pick up a copy. This book has been around for quite a while so there are many places students can pick up this book for little to no cost. Along with my lectures I will post relevant sections of this book one should consider reading. 

2. Mathematical Statistics by Leemis (1st Edition): https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Statistics-Lawrence-Leemis/dp/0982917465

This is a more undergraduate-friendly text. Most of our homework problems will be selected from this book. I will post the problems so that purchase of the book is not required. I will also post the sections of this book one should read along with the lecture notes (as appropriate). 



# Office Hours

Office hours will be held on zoom at https://cwm.zoom.us/my/gjhunt, times will be Tuesdays 3-4 PM EST and Thursdays 9-10AM EST. Additionally, I am happy to meet by appointment, send me an email gjhunt@wm.edu

** Office hours will begin next week. **

# Weekly Quiz Problems (QPs)

Each week I will post a quiz problem (QP) that will be due the following Thursday at 11:59 PM EST. The quiz problem will be graded. In total, your grades on the quiz problems will account for 20% of your final grade. The lowest two QP grades will be dropped. The QPs are intended to be completed alone so do not discuss them with your peers.

QPs will be submitted on Blackboard under the appropriate assignment. No late submissions will be accepted for QPs. If they are not submitted on blackboard by 11:59 on Thursday a zero will be entered for the grade. By droppping the lowest two grades, missing one or two won't hurt your grade. If there are extenuating circumstances and you cannot submit the problem, please let me know in advance ASAP.

** The first QP has already been posted. **

# Suggested Problems (SPs)

Additionally I will post a selection of suggested problems along with solutions. You are **highly** encouraged to do these problems as just doing just the one quiz problem will not be enough to prepare you for the midterms and final. I will also post suggested reading along with the suggested problems.

# Midterms

There will be two remote midterm exams. The first will be Tuesday March 9th 7-9 PM EST. The second will be April 13th 7-8 PM EST. More information will be given closer to that date. Each midterm will account for 25% of the final grade for a total of 50% across the two midterms. 

# Final

There will be a similar remote final exam. This will take place Tuesday May 18th 7-10 PM EST. The final will account for 30% of the final grade. The final is cumulative.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if there are questions of concerns. My email is ghunt@wm.edu. Look forward to hearing from me Thursday with our first lecture in the exciting world of mathematical statistics.
